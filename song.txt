[Verse 1]
Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we’re trouble
Well that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn’t me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be
-2-
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You wouldn't know me at all today
From the fading light, I fly

[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
